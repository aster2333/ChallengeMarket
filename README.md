# ActionFi — Like Pumpfun for Real World UGC prediction market for action. Act, bet, vote and win.
### Problem
In Web3, belief and execution are disconnected:
•	Prediction markets price opinions but not real actions.
•	Task platforms reward completion but lack transparency and market dynamics.
There’s no native way to monetize credibility, accountability, or proof of action on-chain.
________________________________________
### Solution
ActionFi creates a market for human execution.
Anyone can launch a public challenge, back outcomes with YES/NO staking, and let the market price belief in real-world actions.
Every challenge is a verifiable on-chain statement — success is rewarded, failure redistributes trust.
________________________________________
### Mechanism
1.	Launch Challenge — Creator deposits ≥0.05 SOL, sets time limit (1 h – 5 d, optional random stop).
2.	Stake Belief — Users stake on YES / NO pools via constant-product AMM.
3.	Host Bidding — Others may outbid the host (+0.1 SOL) to “take the stage.”
4.	Resolution — Chain verifies proof (video / on-chain evidence).
o	YES wins → supporters share NO pool.
o	NO wins → skeptics share YES pool.
5.	Rewards
o	Creator earns 1 % of total pool if challenge succeeds.
o	5 % of pot → JP reward pool for top challengers.
o	Host (if NO wins) gets 2 % of JP.
6.	Second-Round Challenge — Winner may reopen next round with 10 % of prior profit → perpetual loop.
